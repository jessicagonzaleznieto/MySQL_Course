# Why learn SQL?
Well, mainly two reasons.
1. The company I have been working for as a Senior Financial Analyst for the last couple of years is undergoing a slow but steady transition into an SQL database. Our BI team is continuously working on creating new reports that rely less on manual input or data stored in Excel and more on automated processes that facilitate the company's efficiency. Learning SQL will allow me to actively participate in this effort and work alongside my teammates in building reports that add value and let us focus on the analysis.
2. The need to gain the ability to manage and analyze data using SQL has become increasingly obvious to me, especially for career advancement purposes. As someone deeply committed to her professional development, I want to learn this new skill. I believe doing so will, at the very least, open new doors and improve my analytic skills.
