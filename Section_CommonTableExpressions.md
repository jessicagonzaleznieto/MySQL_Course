# SECTION - COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS#

In SQL, every query -and sometimes part of a query or subquery- produces a result or a temporary dataset.

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary named result set within a SQL query that can be referenced within the same query. It's defined using the WITH clause at the beginning of a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs improve readability and maintainability of complex SQL queries by allowing you to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. They can be recursive, meaning they can reference themselves, enabling tasks like hierarchical data querying. CTEs are particularly useful for tasks such as data manipulation, recursive queries, and creating readable and maintainable SQL code.

```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    -- CTE definition query here
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE conditions
)
-- Main query using the CTE
SELECT *
FROM cte_name;
```
